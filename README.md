# Gazebo Wave Simulator


This package contains plugins that support the simulation and visualisation
of waves in Gazebo. It is a simplified version of the
[full wave simulator](https://github.com/srmainwaring/asv_wave_sim/):
it includes a trochoidal wave generator but excludes boat dynamics. It comprises
a visual plugin for the Gazebo client that synchronises the rendered scene with
the wave physics running in the server.

## Dependencies

You will need a working installation of ROS and Gazebo in order to use this package.


## Ubuntu

- Ubuntu 18.04
- ROS Melodic Morenia
- Gazebo version 9.0.0

### macOS

- OSX 10.11.6
- ROS Melodic Morenia
- Gazebo version 9.6.0

## Installation

### Create and configure a workspace

Source your ROS installation:

```bash
source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
source /usr/local/share/gazebo-9/setup.bash
```

Create a catkin workspace:

```bash
mkdir -p wave_ws/src
cd wave_ws
catkin init
```

Configure catkin:

```bash
catkin config --cmake-args \
  -DCATKIN_ENABLE_TESTING=1 \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
```

### Clone and build the package

Clone the `wave_sim_vrx` repository:

```bash
cd src
git clone https://github.com/srmainwaring/wave_sim_vrx.git wave_sim
```

Compile the packages:

```bash
catkin build
```

or with tests:

```bash
catkin build --catkin-make-args run_tests
```

## Usage

The wiki has details about how to configure and use the plugins:

- [WavefieldPlugin](https://github.com/srmainwaring/asv_wave_sim/wiki/WavefieldPlugin)
- [WavefieldVisualPlugin](https://github.com/srmainwaring/asv_wave_sim/wiki/WavefieldVisualPlugin)

## Tests

Manually run the tests:

```bash
./devel/lib/wave_gazebo_plugins/UNIT_Wavefield_TEST
```

## Examples

![Wave Simulation](https://github.com/srmainwaring/asv_wave_sim/wiki/images/ocean_waves_box_example.gif)

Launch a Gazebo session with `roslaunch`:

```bash
roslaunch wave_gazebo ocean_world.launch verbose:=true
```

Publish a wave parameters message:

```bash
./devel/lib/wave_gazebo_plugins/WaveMsgPublisher \
  --number 3 \
  --amplitude 1 \
  --period 7 \
  --direction 1 1 \
  --scale 2 \
  --angle 1 \
  --steepness 1
```
